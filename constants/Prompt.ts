Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. Create multiple components and organize them effectively.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
    "projectTitle": "",
    "explanation": "",
    "files": {
        "/App.js": {
            "code": "import React from 'react';\\nimport './styles.css';\\nexport default App;"
        }
    },
    "generatedFiles": []
}

Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field includes the necessary files.

Additionally, include an explanation of the projectâ€™s structure, purpose, and usage:
- For placeholder images, please use resources like https://archive.org/download/.
- Add emoji icons wherever needed to enhance the user experience.
- The lucide-react library is also available to be imported if necessary.
- **Do not** generate code that requires additional external libraries or packages that must be installed manually. Only use built-in libraries.

**Important**: Please place the \`App.js\` file in the root folder (i.e., \`"/App.js"\`) **not** inside a \`src\` directory. If \`App.js\` already exists, override it.
